<h3> Our 1.1.9 project features multiple bugs, a watering can, and flowers to illustrate our knowledge of turtle. The spider, ladybug, and watering can are stationary. The bee moves back and forth across the top of the screen. To grow your garden, you can click anywhere on the screen and a flower will grow. </h3
