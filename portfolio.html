<h2> Grow Your Own Garden </h2>
<img src="1.1.9_project.png" height="400">
<h3> Our 1.1.9 project features multiple bugs, a watering can, and flowers to illustrate our knowledge of turtle. The spider, ladybug, and watering can are stationary. The bee moves back and forth across the top of the screen. To grow your garden, you can click anywhere on the screen and a flower will grow. </h3

<h2> Cross the Lake </h2>
<img src="1.2.5_project.png" height="400">
<h3> In our 1.2.5 project, a racer tries to cross the lake full of turtles. The turtles move across the lake at various speeds. If the racer hits the turtle, the racer resets. Once the racer crossers the river, the game is over, and the top displays "Congrats! You made it across!" </h3>
